# Day 005: SELinux Installation and Configuration

Following a security audit, the security team has opted to enhance application and server security with SELinux. To initiate testing, the following requirements have been established for App server 3 in the x Datacenter:


Install the required SELinux packages.

Permanently disable SELinux for the time being; it will be re-enabled after necessary configuration changes.

No need to reboot the server, as a scheduled maintenance reboot is already planned for tonight.

Disregard the current status of SELinux via the command line; the final status after the reboot should be disabled.
