# Day 086: Ansible Ping Module Usage
The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:


a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user from jump host.


b. There is an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump host. Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 1, make sure ping works.
