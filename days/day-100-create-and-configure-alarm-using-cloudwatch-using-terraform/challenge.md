# Day 100: Create and Configure Alarm Using CloudWatch Using Terraform
The Nautilus DevOps team has been tasked with setting up an EC2 instance for their application. To ensure the application performs optimally, they also need to create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the instance's CPU utilization. The alarm should trigger if the CPU utilization exceeds 90% for one consecutive 5-minute period. To send notifications, use the SNS topic named datacenter-sns-topic, which is already created.

Launch EC2 Instance: Create an EC2 instance named datacenter-ec2 using any appropriate Ubuntu AMI (you can use AMI ami-0c02fb55956c7d316).

Create CloudWatch Alarm: Create a CloudWatch alarm named datacenter-alarm with the following specifications:

Statistic: Average
Metric: CPU Utilization
Threshold: >= 90% for 1 consecutive 5-minute period
Alarm Actions: Send a notification to the datacenter-sns-topic SNS topic.
Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to create a EC2 Instance and CloudWatch Alarm.

Create an outputs.tf file to output the following values:

KKE_instance_name for the EC2 instance name.
KKE_alarm_name for the CloudWatch alarm name.

Notes:

The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform.

Right-click under the EXPLORER section in VS Code and select Open in Integrated Terminal to launch the terminal.

Before submitting the task, ensure that terraform plan returns No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
